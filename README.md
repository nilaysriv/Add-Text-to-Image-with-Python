# Add-Text-to-Image-with-Python
Project I made for my Bioinformatics Club [Praedictio] to automate creation of e-certificates by automatically filling the names from an excel sheet

On the client system, the user needs python3, python3-pip installed.

The following commmand will install the libraries needed for working of the script

pip install opencv-python openpyxl PILLOW Image
